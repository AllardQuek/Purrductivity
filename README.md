# Purrductivity

Tired of installing so many different browser extensions, or perhaps not even knowing which extensions to install? Purrductivity is a Chrome extension designed to enhance the work experience and provide practical benefits for employees. The primary concept revolves around an interactive Pet character that jumps around the browser. The Pet is accompanied by a chatbot powered by ChatGPT that allows users to ask questions and engage in conversations. In addition to the interactive elements, the extension incorporates productivity features such as a time tracker, reading time estimates, and a focus mode for viewing certain web pages. These features help users manage their time effectively and maintain focus during work sessions. By combining enjoyment, practicality, and productivity, the extension aims to create a more enjoyable and fulfilling work environment for employees.
